1. Suppose you want to create a vector of the numbers 100 to 1, where 100 is written 100 times, 99 is written 99 times and so on till 1 is written 1 time, namely 100,100,...,3,3,3,2,2,1. Provide an R command that can help you do this.  
*Hint:* Check the `rep` command in R.

```{r}

```
2. Suppose you have a vector `A <- c(1,2,0,4)` and a vector `B <- c(3,6)`, then what is the
result of `A*B` in R?
```{r}

```

3. Run the following R commands and explain the numbers that appear, each time we run
table(gender).  

- `> gender <- factor(c(rep("female", 91), rep("male", 92)))`       
 `> table(gender)`      

-  `> gender <- factor(gender, levels=c("male", "female"))`  
  `> table(gender)`    
  
-  `> gender <- factor(gender, levels=c("Male", "female"))`    
  `> table(gender)`     

```{r}

```
4. Suppose we want to convert a factor variable to a numeric variable in, how do we do so? For
example, convert the factor variable below to numeric.  
`> X <- factor(c(4, 5, 6, 6, 4))`

```{r}
```

5. Load the dataframe mtcars available with the base R installation in data. The data was
extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10
aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models).

(a) Use `ggplot()` or `qplot()` to plot the weight versus miles per gallon and comment on the relationship.

(b) Add to this plot, a coloring of the points based on the number of cylinders, and the sizing
of the points based on the displacement (volume) of the car.

(c) Use the `tapply()` function to compute the standard deviation of the mpg for groups with
the same number of cylinders.

```{r}
```
